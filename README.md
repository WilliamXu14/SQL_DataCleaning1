# SQL_DataCleaning1

In this project, I cleaned up data to be used for further analysis. The data shows the number of layoffs in several companies.

To do that, there are several steps that have been done:
1. Remove any duplicates
2. Standardized data
3. Check null values
4. Remove unnecessary data
